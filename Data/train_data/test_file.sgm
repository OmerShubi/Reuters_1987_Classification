<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
from emerging in the global economy.
    In remarks before the afternoon session of the
International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he
was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
    "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to give
it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
when the wind shifts."
    He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" but
added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
some policies.
    Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyond
macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
relevance to the imbalances we face today."
    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given
a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article
IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.
    Baker also told the policy making group that it was time
for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF
surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
public.
    "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF
appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of
follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF
recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
procedures," he said.
    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for moving
beyond rhetoric to action."
    He said they provide "more structure to the system, and
induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
policy coordination."
    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
    "This should be matter of priority for the executive board,"
he said.
    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative
medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help us
focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
implications of these options."
    He said also that further work should be done on finding
paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.
    "If we are to take effective remedial action when there are
significant deviations from an intended course, then we must
have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for
key variables," he said.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE CALLS HIGHER JAPAN DEFENSE SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House today supported a call for
Japan to boost its defense spending to help share the burden of
protecting Western interests in sensitive areas around the
world, including in the Gulf.
    House member approved a measure that would require
Secretary of State George Shultz to enter into talks with Japan
on increasing Japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct of
its gross national product.
    The measure, passed during consideration of the 1988-89
State Department funding bill would not require an increase,
but legislators called on Japan to spend more on defense. The
Senate must approve the measure before it becomes law.
    "We don't have to bash the Japanese. We have to show them
how to share the burden of the defense of the free world," said
Rep. Robert Dornan, a California Republican.
    The amendment calls on Shultz to enter into talks with
Japan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of two
alternatives: either Japan can spend 3 pct of its GNP on
defense by itself or give the equivalent amount of money to the
United States as a kind of security fee.
